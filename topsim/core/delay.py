class DelayModel:
    """
    The delay model is the delay or failure model for tasks in a workflow.
    If we have a possibility for delay, then the timeout triggered by a process
    will be increased by a certain portion.

    A delay model object may be passed to any of the actors within the
    simulation that yield a timeout to the environment. Each actor will store
    their expected (current) timeouts and, if present, the actual timeout
    if a delay has been triggered.

    Attributes
    ----------
    prob : float
        The probabilty a delay will occur

    dist : str
        String name of the distribution from which values will be picked to
        create a delay.

        Currently normal, poisson, and uniform distributions from numpy are
        supported. If

    degree : enumerate.Enum (float)
        The 'degree' to which we will be generating the delay. The higher
        degree, the larger the final delay.
