This script runs a default simulation, with no 'bells and whistles'.
It uses a standard scheduling and planning model with no failures,
and a homogneoues cluster system.

The only requirements are the SHADOW library implementations of static
scheduling algorithms for the Planner interface, Simpy, and numby/matplotlib.
