        timestep and then once these decisions have been resolved, yield a
        timeout to indicate a single timestep has passed for the Telescope.

        Decisions made within this function are:

            * Check telescope capacity for running new observations

            * Communicate with Scheduler to determine if the Buffer and Cluster
            have capacity to run a new Observation (Ingest and Storage
            conditions).

            and observation is scheduled for observation.

            * Finalise an Observation and initiate the 'clean-up'.

        Notes
        -----
        The procedure here follows an 'observation-led' approach to
        determining if the observation is able to run (hence
        `observation.is_ready()`. The idea is the
        observation is standard across any implementation of Instrument,
        so it's easier for user-definied instruments to defer to the
        observation to determine if it is possible to run the observation (
        i.e. have the observation check if it's Start/End time conditions
        have been met).
