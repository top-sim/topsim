This set of pages details information for those new to running TopSim, or who want an overview of the components involved. These pages cover:

    * How to install verify the installation (including using the optional libraries required to runtests);
    * Introduction to the terminology of TopSim (such as actors) and a motivating example
    * Example code snippets that detail a complete simulation

For more information on the specific requirements for simulation configuration, please look at the Configuration section. If you are interested in how to use the user defined classes that are necessary to implementing your own planning and scheduling heuristics, please look at the Planning and Scheduling page. There is also a Reference index that provides documentation for the core elements of the TopSim library, in addition to some example user-defined planning and scheduling implementations.
